 Patient Intake
I have automated the intake workflow, covering the following modules and scenarios:

1. Login Screen: Verification of valid and invalid login/password scenarios.
2. Practice List Verification: Validation of the practice list displayed after a successful login.
3. Provider Verification: Validation of valid/invalid provider, along with search functionality.
4. Connected Practice and Appointment Verification: Verification of the connected practice, current date, appointment time, and conversion of the current date into the expected format.
5. Patient Search: Verification of valid/invalid patient search, capturing the appointment time.
6. DOB Verification: Validation of valid and invalid date of birth (DOB).
7. Post-Authentication Validation: After successful authentication, verifying the appointment time, practice name, provider with whom the appointment is, and the steps to be completed.
This Automation we can use in sanity Testing and regression Testing.
